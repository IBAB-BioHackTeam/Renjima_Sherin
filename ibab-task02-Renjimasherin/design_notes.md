I chose class-based design so the DNA sequence stays inside one object. This makes code super easy to use because:

- No need to pass sequence again and again everywhere
- All functions work on same object
- Easy to add more features later

Class stores only one thing: "self.seq"  
Simple and beginner-friendly, no confusion
